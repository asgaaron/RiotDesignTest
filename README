Hi! Welcome to my spell calculator, a project to practice leveraging RIOT's 
public API.

This calculator is pretty crude at this point. 
Currently, it's main function is to calculate the highest damage single-cast 
spell at varying levels of AD, AP, and health.
Spells that enhance auto-attacks, such as Xin's Q are not considered. Spells 
that do not deal damage are not considered.

However, the calculator does not know anything about its target or the current 
state of the champion casting the spell. Things like %health, current health are
not taken into calculation.

Notes:
Spell damages are always calculated at their highest possible values. For 
example, Taric's Dazzle is calculated as if he casted it from 0 range, 
Morgana's Tormented Soil is calculated as if the target has 1% health,Sion's 
Decimating Smash uses the fully charged spell damage, and Kassadin's Riftwalk 
is on its highest stack.

All of Lux's spells are missing effect fields from the Riot API, base damages 
will have to be hard-coded.

Ryze, Garen are missing Var fields, spell calculation may be inaccurate unless 
hard-coded values are added.

Features planned:

Addition of a customizable target
// Target's stats including Armor, MR, CurrentHealth, MaxHealth, AD, and AP.
// This will make calculation MUCH more accurate. For spells that 
// rely heavily on target's health, such as Mundo's Infected Cleaver, minimum
// damage is currently used.

Customizable spell levels
// Currently all spell damage is calculated at the spell's max rank. Adding 
// customizable spell levels would allow calculation for scenarios like best
// level-one spell, best level 6 spell, etc.

Ability to ask about context-specific spells
// E.g. 'How many of Syndra's spheres are around when she uses her ult?' or 
// 'How much damage will the target take while Zed's mark is active?'

Automatic parsing of sanitized tooltip
// Currently, the method of obtaining spell damage is pretty brute force. Will 
// require a lot of maintenance in the future. I would rather create a way to 
// parse this automatically.

Add functionality for calculating DPS
// Currently, CDR is a little useless. A 'Calculate DPS' function could 
// calculate damage done over user-defined periods of time, taking spell 
// cooldown into consideration.

Add functionality to calculate the damage of a specified spell
// Gets the name of a spell from the user, then calculates spell damage and 
// prints to the screen
